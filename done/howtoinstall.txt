• Install Adobe Illustrator CS6 as trial while disconnected from the net (or block outgoing connections)
• Do not enter an Adobe ID, Select 'Connect later'
• Once installed, launch and quit application at least once, blocking any outgoing connections as necessary.
• Replace (keep a copy of the original just in case) amtlib.framework in Application_Name.app/Contents/Frameworks/ with cracked one.
• IMPORTANT : Block outgoing connections.
